  "description": "## Description BooksVsMovies is a web application that allows the user to search for the title of a book or a movie and compares the two titles side by side.  The user then is allowed to leave their mark on the page by giving the titles a thumbs-up, if they enjoy the title, or a thumbs-down, if they disliked the title. The user can also display which one they prefer more by leaving a thumbs-up on one title and a thumbs-down on the other title. If the user searches for a title that doesnt exist, the search will not go through.",
